	<p>Sekolah Kebangsaan Pak Roman was my primary school.<br>
		It was located in a small village called Kampung Pak Roman in Machang Kelantan.<br>
		I am studying in this school started from my pre-school(2006) until standard 6 (2012).<br>
		When i was in standard 6, I have been required to sit for Ujian Penilaian <br>
		Sekolah Rendah (UPSR) and have obtained 5A's.

		After UPSR, I was given the opportunity to attend a boarding school,<br>
		Sekolah Menengah Sains Sultan Mahmud or better known as SESMA that is <br>
		located in Kuala Nerus, Terengganu. I have been studying here for 5 years <br>
		from form 1 (2013) to form 5 (2017). While attending school here,<br>
		I managed to sit for the Ujian Pentaksiran Tingkatan 3 (PT3) by getting 9A 1B. <br> 
		Then i take the pure science course for my upper form and managed to sit for <br>
		Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia by getting 5A's.

		After SPM, i decided to apply for Information Management program at MARA University<br>
		 of Technology (UiTM) and thankfully i got it at the nearest branch from where i live which<br> 
		 is UiTM Machang Kelantan. This programme is  designed to produce professionals who are conversant
		 <br> in the delivery of knowledge services in organisations and have the skills to manage information<br>
		  in a digitised format. Your learning experiences will include among others, the organization of information,<br>
		   librarianship skills, database fundamentals, management of information resources including electronic and digital 
		   <br>resources, and developing your information literacy. Before entering the University, i have no idea what programme<br>
		   is this. But, i managed to get a good result for the every semester.
