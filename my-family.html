		<p style="text-align: left; margin: 80px" > Family is an integral part of one's life. It does not matter if you have a small
			or big family as long as you have one. Family is very important and valuable to people and is something that should never be taken for granted. Without a family, a large part of someone's life would be missing. I am very grateful to be blessed with a small family that consist of 5 members including me.
			<br><br>
		First of all I am going to introduce to my dutiful and respected father. His name is Paizon Bin Abdul Wahab. He is 55 years old. When I was a child, my father taught me and my siblings with the strict discipline. He's also show us the right path to his children and motivates them to achieve the goals of their lives through proper education.
			<br><br>
		My mother's name is Rubiah Binti Hassan, a 57 full-time housewife. She is a very loving person I've ever met. She's always encouraged and supported me in every situation I faced. 

		<br><br>
		Besides mom and dad, I also have two annoying older sisters. The oldest one is Azmazazabilla or I just call her zaza. She is 26 years old currently unemployed as she is just finished her degree (Bachelor in Finance) at University Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS). The second sister is Azmah Ayuni, she is 23 years old and currently studying in Universiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris (UPSI).

	I think that is all i can tell you about my simple family.
